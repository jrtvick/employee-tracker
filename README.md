# employee-tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a back end application built using JavaScript (Node.js and Express,) Object-oriented Programming, and MySQL. This program is designed to allow the user to manage their employees in the terminal in order to keep track of their roster of staff and workplace hierarchy. An employee tracker is a helpful tool for any business owner, providing the user with the ability to observe and create their company's hierarchy in the terminal. With this application, the user no longer needs to spend time manually writing down their company's staff structure. Through simple mouse and keyboard usage they can quickly generate this information.
